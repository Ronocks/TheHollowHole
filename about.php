<h3>Our History</h3>
<br>
<h5> The Hollow Hole was established in 1995 by Sean McPhillips.<h5>
<h5> Sean was your typical Irish gentleman who could be found  <h5>
<h5> in the local every weekend looking for a new career path<h5>
<h5> After inspiration from his families home cooked meals, <h5>
<h5> he decided to open a restaurant named after their family farm 'The Hollow Hole' <h5>
<h5> Over time Sean has improved not only his locations but the quality and care<h5>
<h5> into the food we provide, granting us one of the few five-star restaurants in Ireland<h5>

<h3>Our Food</h3>
<br>
<h5> Like Seans childhood, all our food is freshly harvested on one of our partnering farms such as the one seen bellow<h5>
<h5> These farms provide meats such as beef, chicken, lamb and fresh veg for our salads and sides<h5>
<h5> Not only do have parters with these farms but also with Dublin bay where fresh fish and shrimp are delivered to us hours after coming<h5>
<h5> from the water. One of our main priorities is to ensure our food<h5>
  <h5> is fresh and worth your time<h5>
